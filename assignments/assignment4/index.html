<h3>Android AsyncTask, Bound Service, and AIDL (Assignment 4)</h3>

<HR width=50% align=left><P>
<H4>Overview of the Assignment</H4>

This two-part assignment will extend elements of your <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS282/tree/master/assignments/assignment3/">assignment
3</A> solution.  In particular, you'll learn how to apply the Android
AsyncTask, Bound Service, and AIDL capabilities to complete an Android
app containing a resource manager that restricts the number of Beings
from Middle-Earth who can concurrently gaze into a limited number of
Palantiri. <P>

This Android program is structured in accordance with the <A
HREf="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter">Model-View-Presenter</A>
(MVP) pattern.  The classes in the <EM>View</EM> layer are provided to
you.  The main PalantiriActivity first prompts the user to enter
various configuration parameters, such as the number of Palantiri and
Beings.  It then starts the GazingSimulationActivity, which
initializes the Presenter layer and then starts the Presenter layer's
processing logic.  The bulk of the concurrent processing is performed
by the two MVP layers: the <EM>Presenter</EM> (which is the focus of
Part 1 of the assignment) and the <EM>Model</EM> (which is the focus
of Part 2 of the assignment).  The Palantiri app should run
successfully without throwing any exceptions if you correctly complete
the skeleton implementations in these layers. <P>

This Android app executes a BeingAsyncTask for each Being using a
fixed-size ThreadPoolExecutor accessed via the Android AsyncTask
framework, which is described <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQJnejqcAZw&index=32&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4tbiFYip6tDNIEBRUDyPQK">here</a>
and <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-o92SLinqk&index=33&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4tbiFYip6tDNIEBRUDyPQK">here</A>.
These tasks will all run concurrently and attempt to acquire a
Palantir and gaze into it for a certain amount of time.  You'll also
need to understand how to program with Android Bound Services and
AIDL, which are described <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxJ8xZpSeIw&index=46&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4tbiFYip6tDNIEBRUDyPQK">here</A>
and <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqw2jaA_PwE&index=47&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4tbiFYip6tDNIEBRUDyPQK">here</A>.

I recommend you watch these videos and look at the code to ensure you
understand how to program all these Android concurrency and
communication mechansims.  Naturally, we'll cover these topics in
class, as well. <P>

<H4>Assignment Structure</H4>

The assignment skeletons are contained in the <A
HREF="A4-Android-App">A4-Android-App</A> folder, which conains the
skeletons you'll need to fill in, as described <A
HREF="#description">below</a>.  You'll need to import this project
into Eclipse as an Android app.

To compile the the A4-Android-App you need to use the provided Eclipse
ADT projects.  You can run this project by right-clicking the
project's name in the Package Explorer and selecting Run As -> Android
Application for A4-Android-App.  Eclipse ADT should automatically
select an Android Emulator to run, assuming you have one created. If
you do not have one created you can create it by opening Window ->
Android Virtual Device Manager. <P>

<P><HR width=50% align=left><P>
<A NAME="description">
<H4>Program Description</H4>

In the src directory of the A4-Android-App directory you'll find a
number of files, all of which you should read.  You'll need to modify
several files containing the skeleton Java code that you'll implement
by completing the "TODO - You fill in here" comments to provide a
working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON
- just fill in the "TODO -- You fill in here" portions!!! <P>

In particular, you'll need to do the following: <P>

<UL>

<LI> <EM>Part 1</EM> -- Finish the implementation of class methods
defined by the Presenter layer's <CODE>PalantiriPresenter.java</CODE>
and <CODE>BeingAsyncTask.java</CODE> files in
<CODE>src/edu/vandy/presenter</CODE>.  In particular, you'll need to
(1) use the Android AsyncTask executeOnExecutor() method to
create/start a BeingAsyncTask for each Being, which concurrently
acquires a Palantir from the Model layer and gazes into it for a
certain amount of time and (2) start a thread that uses a
CountDownLatch object to coordinate the ending of the simulation and
then inform the View layer that the simulation is done. <P>

<LI> <EM>Part 2</EM> -- Finish the implementation of class methods
defined by the Model layer's <CODE>PalantiriModel.java</CODE>,
<CODE>PalantiriManager.aidl</CODE>, <CODE>LeaseCallback.aidl</CODE>,
<CODE>PalantiriLeasePool.java</CODE>, and
<CODE>PalantiriService.java</CODE> files in
<CODE>src/edu/vandy/model/</CODE>.  These implementations require
knowledge of Android Bound Service and AIDL capabilities. <P>

</UL>

The Palantir and Beings are color coded to represent their state: <P>

<UL>

<LI> <B>Beings</B> - Yellow means the Being is idle, Red means it's
waiting to acquire a Palantir, Green means it's gazing into a
Palantir, and Purple means the gazing was interrupted due to the lease
expiring.<P> 

<LI> <B>Palantiri</B> - Gray means the Palantir is inactive, Green
means it is available for use, and Red means it is in use (i.e., a
Being is currently gazing into it).<P>

</UL>

A "correct" simulation should restrict the number of gazing Beings to
the number of Palantiri.  In other words, if there are four Palantiri
in the simulation, then only four Being dots should ever be Green on
the screen at a time. <P>

<H4>Additional Work for Graduate Students</H4>

Graduate students (or any student who is taking this course for
graduate credit) must do the following additional work:

<UL>

<LI> <EM>Part 1</EM> -- Implement a CyclicBarrier to ensure that all
BeingAsyncTasks begin at the same time. <P>

<LI> <EM>Part 2</EM> -- Replace the use of the
GenericServiceConnection object with the conventional
ServiceConnection in the PalantiriModel.java file.  </UL>

The additional work required by graduate students is clearly marked in
the skeletons.

<H4>Skeleton Code</H4>

The skeleton code for both parts of this assignment is available from
my <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS282/tree/master/assignments/assignment4/">GitHub</a>
account.  Once you've setup your <A
HREF="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can pull this
skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and complete the
"TODO" markers. <P>

<HR width=50% align=left><P>
<H4>Concluding Remarks</H4>

This two-part assignment is designed to deepen your knowledge of
multi-threaded programs using Eclipse and Eclipse ADT, the Android
AsyncTask framework, Bound Service, and AIDL.  There are more "TODO"
markers to fill out than in the earlier assignments, so I recommend
starting early and asking questions if you run into problems. <P>
